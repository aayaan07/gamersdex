# 🎮 GamersDex

GamersDex is a modern gaming profile platform where players can showcase their gaming journey, track completed titles, earn ranks, and gain community recognition through Aura.

It’s designed to be a clean, minimal, and performance-focused space for gamers who want a public identity beyond traditional social media.

## 🌟 What is GamersDex?

GamersDex is a public gamer identity system.

Instead of just playing games, you build a profile that represents:
- Your completed games
- Your current playthroughs
- Your wishlist
- Your progression rank
- Your reputation (Aura)

Each user gets a unique, shareable profile link:
